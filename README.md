README for GA Capstone project

Heroku site: https://algorithms-playground-bader.herokuapp.com/

Elevator Pitch:
Welcome to Algorithm Playgroud! Here you can explore different prompts of different types of algorithm topics including Arrays, strings, linked lists, and more in preparation for your technical interview! Click on each of the topics and see different relevant technical prompts that you can click on. With each prompt that goes along with each algorithm topic, as well as a visualizer and a corresponding solution that you can toggle on and off. The visualizers are still currently under construction and being optimized at the moment, but the topic corresponding workspaces are completely set up with no bugs and the library is prompt library is continually growing! 

List of technologies:
- Mongodb Database
- Full-Stack MongoDB, Express, Node.js application
- Languages: Javascript, HTML, CSS
- jQuery and DOM manipulation used throughout the app
- MVC architecture used
- there are 6 database schema/models corresponding to the different topics (Arrays, Lists, Trees, Stacks, Recursion, and Other)
- Flexbox is used for styling as well, jQuery is also used with CANVAS to style the visualizer space

Installation steps:
- Clone down with normal steps (git clone)
- npm i for the dependencies
- you'll need to set up a new database and local port

Important Notes, Bugs, Future Directions
- this app is currently in an MVP state where all the basic functionalities are working
- The canvas jquery feature is semi working, and will be adding relevant scripts to the prompt library shortly, currently there is a simple canvas jquery place holder to show functionality of the linked scripts but no actual visualizer scripts yet
- one canvas bug is that the image doesn't always show, sometimes need to hit the reset button first then run to show the canvas image
- second canvas but is that it doesn't reset the drawing "thickness" when the image is reset. Tried to fix with conditionals but still doesn't work exactly right yet
